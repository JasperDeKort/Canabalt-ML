# Canabalt-ML
Using a neural network to play Canabalt ( a 1 button endless runner) from player examples.

requirements:
  - windows 
  - canabalt in windowed mode, 800x600 in top left corner of screen
  - python 3.6
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - opencv3
  - pywin32
  
depending on the version used you also need one of these:
  - sklearn
  - tensorflow
  

the neural network to play the game is built from data of me playing the game. the performance at this time is not great. A version using a convoluted neural network in tensorflow is in the works. and there are plans to rebuild this using reinforcement learning instead.

all of this was developed using anaconda.
